### Kia ora whanu ðŸ‘‹

After embarking on a journey with Javascript [@dev](https://devacademy.co.nz/) four years ago, my path led me to co-found an educational technology startup in Whangarei known as [NGEN Room](https://www.ngenroom.co.nz/). This exciting venture shifted my role from hands-on coding to a dynamic blend of project management, communications, and leadership. Fast forward four years, and NGEN Room is thriving, allowing me the opportunity to take a step back.

Reflecting on my journey, I recall the ambitious yet incomplete projects I once pursued and the wealth of knowledge gained from countless tech workshops. Now, I'm circling back to my coding roots, dedicating my spare time to reigniting my skills. With a renewed enthusiasm, I'm diving back into JavaScript, and eagerly exploring the realms of TypeScript and Python. The road ahead is full of possibilities, and I'm excited to see where this rekindled passion may lead me.
